Step into my programming learning journey repository! 
Here, I've gathered a bunch of hands-on projects that showcase my adventure in the captivating realm of programming. 
Each project is a snapshot of my growth, exploring various topics and concepts. 

As i progress from beginner to advanced topics, I prepare myself to apply these tools toward sustainability and data science in a green economy.

With this course in Scientific Computing with Python, I learn Advanced topics like lambda functions, data structures like arrays and linked lists, algorithms like binary search tree and recursion. Some projects also focus on object oriented programming (OOP) with classes, inheritance and methods.
